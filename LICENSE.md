and the licensee (the user of the software and the databases)

regarding the use of the following software

- the low-level C++ template SIMD library
- the SIMD implementation of the MinWarping and the 2D-Warping methods
  for local visual homing

in the following referred to as "the software",

and on the use of the

- panoramic image databases

in the following referred to as "the databases".

1.  The licensor grants the licensee the non-exclusive,
    non-transferable, non-licensable right to use and modify the
    software and the databases. The software and the databases are
    licensed free of charge.

2.  The licensee agrees not to transfer or to disclose the software
    and the databases in original or modified form to other
    individuals or to other institutions.

3.  The software and the databases will only be used for the
    licensee's own scientific study, scientific research, or academic
    teaching. Use for commercial or business purposes is not
    permitted. Use for any purposes with military background is not
    permitted.

4.  The licensee agrees not to use the software and the databases in
    applications where the life and health of humans and the property
    of humans or institutions is potentially endangered.

5.  The software is provided entirely in the form of source code. It
    is the sole responsibility of the licensee to check the
    correctness of all parts of the software that are used by the
    licensee. The licensee has to be able to understand the
    functionality of all parts of the software that the licensee
    uses. The licensee accepts that the software was not tested in
    depth and agrees to perform in-depth tests and to correct errors
    for all parts that are used by the licensee.

6.  The software contains code fragments taken from other software
    which is licensed by "The MIT license"
    (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and code fragments from
    software help sites on the internet (e.g. stackoverflow.com). The
    software was inspired by and contains code fragments from Agner
    Fog's "Vector Class Library"
    (http://www.agner.org/optimize/#vectorclass). Agner Fog declared
    that he sees no violation of his copyright by the software in its
    present form.

7.  Because the software and the databases are provided free of
    charge, there is no warranty for the software and the databases
    (to the extent permitted by applicable law). The software
    including the databases is provided "as is" without warranty of
    any kind, without even the implied warranty of merchantability or
    fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk of using the
    software and the databases lies with the licensee.

8.  In no event (unless required by applicable law) will the licensor
    or any contributor be liable for any claim, any sort of damage or
    any other liability arising from the use of the software and the
    databases or arising from the inability to use the software and
    the databases.

9.  The licensor is not obligated to provide any support for the
    licensee regarding the use of the software and the databases.

10. This license agreement comes into force without signatures as
    soon as the licensee obtains the software and/or the
    databases. If the licensee disagrees with any of the clauses of
    this license, the licensee is not permitted to obtain or keep the
    software and the image databases.

11. Should any provision of this license agreement be or become
    invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining
    provisions. Any invalid provision shall be replaced by a valid
    provision which corresponds to the meaning and purpose of the
    invalid provision.

12. This license agreement (files LICENSE, LICENSE.md and LICENSE.doc) has to
    accompany the files of the software and the files of the
    databases. The header text of the source files referring to the
    license agreement has to remain unchanged.

13. German law applies and the place of jurisdiction is Bielefeld.
