# Notes for Developers

## Generating the documentation

Generating the documentation requires `doxygen` 1.9.7 or later (https://www.doxygen.nl) (earlier versions may work, but have not been tested).

To generate the documentation, run

```shell
$ make doc
```

The documentation will be in the folder `doc_html`.
To view the generated documentation, open the file `doc_html/index.html` in a web browser.

The configuration file for documentation generation is contained in the file `Doxyfile` (this is also where the files to be included in the documentation are specified).

## Generating the single-header include file

Generating the single-header include file requires `quom` which is written in Python and can be installed with

```shell
$ pip3 install --user quom
```

for example
(see https://github.com/Viatorus/quom).

Once `quom` is installed, run

```shell
$ make single-header
```

to generate the single-header include file `tsimd_sh.H` which can now be distributed and included in projects on its own.

## Testing

To test the library, compile the test programs with

```shell
$ make autotest
```

and run them:

```shell
$ ./simdvecautotest0
$ ./simdvecautotest1
$ ./simdvecautotestM
$ ./simdvecautotest_load_store
```

### Testing different configurations automatically

To automatically run the tests for different architectures, compilers and other configurations, use the `autotest.py` script. This script uses the [IntelÂ® Software Development Emulator](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/software-development-emulator.html) for testing the T-SIMD library with architecture features that are not available on the current CPU.

The script compiles and runs the tests for different configurations in parallel, so it is recommended to run the script on a machine with many cores and a lot of RAM.

The script can be run with

```shell
$ ./autotest.py
```

The results of the tests are written into a directory starting with `autotest_` followed by the hostname of the machine and the current date and time.

## Overview over the project structure

### Files

The whole library consists only of C++ header files, since it is a template library. All files of the T-SIMD library are prefixed with `SIMD` (with the exception of `TimeMeasurement.H`, which is also used by other parts of WarpingSIMD and `tsimd.H`, which is the main include file for the T-SIMD library) and end in `.H`.

The header files are structured in such a way that every single header file is self-contained, meaning including any other file than the main include file `tsimd.H` (while not necessarily recommended) does not lead to any errors, as well as the order of including the header files does not matter, enabling the code formatter to sort the includes alphabetically. So every header file should include all the header files it needs itself (and not rely on other header files to include them).

### Namespaces

The library uses namespaces for code organization. The main namespace is `simd` where all code for the library is located.

#### Internal Code

All internal code is contained in the namespace `simd::internal`, such that all code intended for use by the user of the library is directly contained in the namespace `simd` (not in any sub-namespace). This forms the public interface of the library.

The main purposes of this are:

- Avoiding users of the library accidentally using internal code that might change in the future or is unintuitive to use.
- Avoiding cluttering suggestions for auto-completion with internal code. (Typing `simd::` and then using auto-completion only shows the public interface this way.)
- Making the separation between public interface and internal implementation clearer.

The internal namespace is further subdivided into the following sub-namespaces for better organization:

- `simd::internal::base`: Contains internal code for base-level functions and classes.
- `simd::internal::ext`: Contains internal code for extension functions built on top of the base-level functions and classes.
- `simd::internal::mask`: Contains internal code for mask functions and classes.
- `simd::internal::auto_test`: Contains code for the tests. This code is not used by the library itself but only by the test programs.

### Implementations for Different Architectures

Choosing different implementations for base level functions, for example, is achieved in the following way:

The file `SIMDVecBase.H` does not contain any implementations, but simply wrapper functions (which are contained directly in the `simd` namespace), that forward to the implementation functions (which are contained in the `simd::internal` namespace). For each supported architecture, there is a separate implementation file containing those implementation functions with a filename starting with `SIMDVecBaseImpl` followed by an appropriate name for the architecture followed by `.H`. For example, the file `SIMDVecBaseImplIntel32.H` contains the implementation for the 32-byte SIMD instruction set extensions of Intel CPUs.

The implementations for the masked functions are handled in a similar way, although since only some of the supported architectures have dedicated mask registers, there is the file `SIMDVecMaskImplEmu.H` containing emulated implementations for masked functions, that are chosen when no more specific implementation is available.

There is also a special "sandbox" implementation for testing (which is activated by defining the macro `SIMDVEC_SANDBOX`), which does not contain any actual implementations, but only prints the function calls to the console.

Other functions than the base level and masked functions also have a similar interface wrapper layer with implementations in the `simd::internal` namespace but without separate implementation files, since they are not architecture-specific.

### Macro "`SIMD_WIDTH_DEFAULT_NATIVE`"

In order to give the `SIMD_WIDTH` template parameter a default value of `NATIVE_SIMD_WIDTH` if `NATIVE_SIMD_WIDTH` is defined but not cause an error if `NATIVE_SIMD_WIDTH` is not defined, the macro `SIMD_WIDTH_DEFAULT_NATIVE` is used. This macro is defined as `SIMD_WIDTH = NATIVE_SIMD_WIDTH` if `NATIVE_SIMD_WIDTH` is defined and as `SIMD_WIDTH` otherwise. It is used in the following way:

```C++
template <typename T, int SIMD_WIDTH_DEFAULT_NATIVE>
struct MySIMDStruct {
  // code using the SIMD_WIDTH template parameter
};
```

## Formatting

The code is formatted with `clang-format` version 16 or newer (https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html, https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) using the configuration file `.clang-format`.

`clang-format` can be installed with the following commands for example:

```shell
$ pip install clang-format
```
or
```shell
$ pip3 install clang-format
```

To format the code, run

```shell
$ make format
```

This will format all files in the project ending in `.C` or `.H`.

The code should ideally be formatted after every change and before making a new release to keep a consistent code style.
